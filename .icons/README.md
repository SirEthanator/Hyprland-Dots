### I DID NOT CREATE THESE CURSORS


### Everforest Cursors Source: [https://github.com/talwat/everforest-cursors](https://github.com/talwat/everforest-cursors)

### Rose Pine Cursors Source: [https://github.com/rose-pine/cursor](https://github.com/rose-pine/cursor)

The reason these cursors are in the repo is because I have included hyprcursor ports here.
