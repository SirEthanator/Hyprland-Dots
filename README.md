## Installation

This section isn't a complete install guide, but just some tips if you plan to install my dotfiles!

- The SetTheme script doesn't change some things such as the Firefox theme. It must be set manually.
- My config defaults to using gtklock now but can be modified to use hyprlock as themes are provided for it.
- I will have missed things both here and in my list of things to install, so don't expect everything to work without installing extra packages.

### Install via script (NOT RECOMMENDED)

The script is currently unfinished and unstable. Use at your own risk!

If you do decide to use this, do not clone the repo beforehand and use this command:

```
$ sh -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirEthanator/Hyprland-Dots/main/install.sh)"
```

Also note that I probably have missed some things in this section, so don't expect everything to work perfectly.
I will try to improve on my dotfiles to be easily usable for anyone!
