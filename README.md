## Installation

This section isn't a complete install guide, but just some tips if you plan to install my dotfiles!

#### Catppuccin

- The SetTheme script doesn't change some things such as the Firefox theme. It must be set manually.
- There is other stuff to install other than what's in the previous section, I may add these later.
- Make sure to install the GTK theme as CatMocha (Rename the directory).
- Ensure that you install the cursors as catppuccin-cursors.

#### Everforest

- Make sure to install the GTK theme as Everforest (Rename the directory).


Also note that I may have missed some things here, so don't expect everything to work perfectly.
I will try to improve on my dotfiles to be easily usable for anyone!
