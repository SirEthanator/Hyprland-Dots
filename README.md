## Installation

This section isn't a complete install guide, but just some tips if you plan to install my dotfiles!

#### Catppuccin

- The SetTheme script doesn't change some things such as the Firefox theme. It must be set manually.
- There is other stuff to install other than what's in the previous section, I may add these later.
- Make sure to install the GTK theme as CatMocha (Rename the directory).
- Ensure that you install the cursors as catppuccin-cursors.

#### Everforest

- Make sure to install the GTK theme as Everforest (Rename the directory).

### Install via script (NOT RECOMMENDED)

The script is currently unfinished and unstable. Use at your own risk!

If you do decide to use this, do not clone the repo beforehand and use this command:

```
$ sh -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirEthanator/Hyprland-Dots/main/install.sh)"
```

Also note that I probably have missed some things in this section, so don't expect everything to work perfectly.
I will try to improve on my dotfiles to be easily usable for anyone!
