## Credits

- My Neovim config is [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) with added plugin config and a tweaked init.lua.
- The GTK theme used is [Colloid](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme) ([this fork](https://github.com/SirEthanator/Colloid-gtk-theme)).
- The icons are also [Colloid](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-icon-theme) ([this fork](https://github.com/SirEthanator/Colloid-icon-theme)).
- Cursors come from [Everforest Cursors](https://github.com/talwat/everforest-cursors), [Catppuccin Cursors](https://github.com/catppuccin/cursors), and [Rose Pine Cursors](https://github.com/rose-pine/cursor).
- My Everforest and Rose Pine Kvantum themes are based on [Catppuccin Kvantum](https://github.com/catppuccin/Kvantum) which is also included in the repo.
- My themes for Swaync are based on [Catppuccin swaync](https://github.com/catppuccin/swaync).
- My Rofi themes are from [this collection of Rofi themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

## Use with

- [Ocean Sound Theme](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/ocean-sound-theme)
- [Everforest Firefox Theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/everforest-dark-hard/)
- [syshud](https://github.com/system64fumo/syshud)

## Installation

This section isn't a complete install guide, but just some tips if you plan to install my dotfiles!

- The SetTheme script doesn't change some things such as the Firefox theme. It must be set manually.
- My config defaults to using gtklock. If you use Hyprlock there are themes for it in this repo.
- There are probably additional things to install/change for the best experience, so don't expect everything working out of the box.

### Install via script (NOT RECOMMENDED)

The script is currently unfinished and unstable. Use at your own risk!

If you do decide to use this, do not clone the repo beforehand and use this command:

```
$ sh -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SirEthanator/Hyprland-Dots/main/install.sh)"
```

Also note that I probably have missed some things in this section, so don't expect everything to work perfectly.
I will try to improve on my dotfiles to be easily usable for anyone!

## TODO

- [ ] New shell to replace Waybar, Rofi, and Swaync (using quickshell).

- [ ] Installation script (May be finished eventually. I don't work on it much since it's boring tbh).
